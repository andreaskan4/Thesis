## 📖 Overview

**Gnosis** is a comprehensive, web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between students, professors, and university administration. Built with the power of **Blazor** and **.NET 8**, it facilitates seamless academic management, real-time communication, and efficient resource sharing in a modern, responsive environment.

## 🚀 Features

The system is compartmentalized into three distinct portals to ensure security and ease of use:

### 🎓 Student Portal
* **Academic Dashboard**: Real-time view of enrolled courses, pending exercises, and grade history.
* **Communication Hub**: Participate in course forums and exchange private messages with instructors.
* **Campus Utilities**: Access the daily cafeteria menu and view official university announcements.
* **Profile Control**: Manage personal contact details and account settings.

### 👨‍🏫 Professor Portal
* **Course Command**: Create curriculums, manage enrollments, and upload assignments.
* **Grading System**: A streamlined interface for inputting and modifying student grades.
* **Direct Engagement**: Post course-wide announcements and answer student queries directly.
* **Professional Profile**: Maintain academic credentials and public contact info.

### 🛠 Admin Portal
* **User Management**: Full control over student and professor accounts (CRUD operations).
* **Curriculum Administration**: Oversee the creation, updating, and deletion of courses.
* **System Oversight**: Generate reports, configure global settings, and update university metadata.
* **Moderation**: Monitor forums and messages to ensure community guidelines.
